            <p>Yyyyeeeellow. I'm Eoghan, a first year computer science student attending UCC. I myself am from the county Waterford; located at the butt of both Ireland, and jokes.</p>

            <h2>About the Website</h2>
            <p>The following website was created for my CS1115 CA. I hope you enjoy traversing it.</p>

            <section id="website-design">
              <h3>Design of the Website</h3>
              <p>If you're a person of considerable life experience, you may recognise the inspiration behind the design of this website as the <i>1987 Apple Macintosh II</i>.</p>
              <p>I liked the idea of having the website have a retro tech feeling. And when I thought of retro tech I was reminded by the <i>Macintosh II</i> that I saw in a <a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/">computing museum</a> on a holiday to London.</p>
              <p>Each webpage is designed to match the style of the application windows of the computer with slight adjustments in the interest of having a visually pleasing website, and in the interest of accessibility, specifically with regards to styling the '<b>X</b>' button to have a <span>red</span> background.</p>
              <p>The website even features a 'desktop view' imitating the original <i>Macintosh II</i>'s desktop. Each webpage link was made to look like the icon for a hard drive. Unfortunately the trash can is not a link.</p>
              <p><small>p.s. You can access the desktop from any webpage by clicking the <span>red</span> 'X' in the top right corner of the 'application'.</small></p>
